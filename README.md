# Decision-Behavior-Learning
This is a small project I made for a Game AI class that I took.  This was the final project, essentially having two AIs that wandered around and chased eachother.

In order to run this simulation, the user has to install Processing, which is essentially a programming language and development environment, and the link for it can be found here: https://processing.org/

In order to compile and run the code, extract the zip file and simply open up the "Decision_Behavior_Learning.pde" file in the "Decision_Behavior_Learning" folder and click the play button at the top of Processing

Decision_Behavior_Learning.pde - this file contains everything for the whole assignment: the decision tree for the player and the behavior tree for the monster.

data folder - this folder contains all of the graphics that I created for use in this project.

log.txt - this file contains the log information that is generated in every run.
